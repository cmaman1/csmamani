My hobbies are reading **science** books, watching **anime**, and taking care of my three **cats** 😺😺😺.

I used to work as an accountant until one day - two years ago - when I was playing and trying new things in my Excel worksheets I discovered macros, Visual Basic, ✨programming✨ and ✨automation✨. It has been a long and beautiful road after that.
